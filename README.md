
# About

This app is not ready, work in progress :)

It is intended to be an app for running tournaments written in python3.

We plan to support games for 2 with outcome presented as points for player A, points for player B.

Planned tournament system: swiss, and we'll add more.

The data will be stored in a local json file, which will be extendable too.
